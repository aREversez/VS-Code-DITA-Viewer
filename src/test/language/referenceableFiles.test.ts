 * Tested through an injected reader rather than through vscode or through real
 * directories, because the rules are the point and none of them are observable
 * from a running editor: whether the walk stops at depth 3 or 4, whether it
 * prunes `out` only at the top or at every level, whether an abandoned request
 * stops reading directories or merely hides the results -- all of these look
 * like "completion shows some files" from the outside.
 *
 * The injected reader also means no fixture directories on disk, so the tests
 * can include shapes a real checkout should never contain (a 240-file folder,
 * an unreadable directory, an `out/` full of generated .dita).
